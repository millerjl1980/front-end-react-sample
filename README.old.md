# React Interview Project
This is a small project for a react interview.

## Goal
Create a React application that retrieves and displays the user repositories and organisations in Github.

## UX/UI
Up to you, probably it should include an input to enter the username, one area to display the repositories of the user and another area to display the organisations

## Retrieving data
To make things easier we have commited a github-api.js file with the REST APIs needed to retrieve the information.

## Bootstrapping the project
Up to you, we recommend [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Submitting the solution
Copy this repository to a repository on your name and add the solution there. It should be clear how to build and run the project locally.

## Bonus (don't need to be in the below specific order)
* Use ES6 syntax including arrow functions, destructuring and async/await
* Adding types with Flow or Typescript
* Adding a spinner when information is loading (up to you on what kind of spinner to implement, but we really like [lottie](https://lottiefiles.com/))
	* Lottie is expensive on the front-end, but if implemented properly it can be cost effective.
* Deal with errors coming from the backend
* Some sort of Unit Test
* Some sort of Integration Test
* Having a nice UI using a components library
	* Here are some of our favorites:
		* [Styled Components](http://styled-components.com/)
		* [Styled Bootstrap Grid](https://github.com/dragma/styled-bootstrap-grid)
		* [Polished](https://polished.js.org/)
		* [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
* Divide the application in different pages and use a router
* Proper project structure and separation of application folders & files.
* Adding state management
* Adding light/dark modes.
* Show common tools used for you daily development environment (linters, code formatter, git workflow, docker and so on)
* Deploy the project somewhere
